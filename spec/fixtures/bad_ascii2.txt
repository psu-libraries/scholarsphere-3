Battery buckets will be removed from all buildings and will be replaced with a two-part system:\nRechargeable Battery Mailer Program\nEach building that formerly had a battery bucket now has a designated contact person who will be given a pre-addressed padded envelope and a roll of small plastic bags. Building occupants with unusable rechargeable batteries should visit the contact person, retrieve a bag for each battery, seal the batteries in the bag(s) and return them to the contact person to place in the envelope. Once the envelope is full, the contact person will send it via campus mail to Environment Health and Safety (EHS) and a new mailer will arrive in the mail soon after. Only rechargeable batteries will be collected through the building mailer program. \n                     \n\nCentral Battery Collection Boxes\nThere will be ten Central Battery Collection Boxes across the University Park campus that will collect both non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries, and small electronics for recycling. Each box has a roll of small bags on the side to package the rechargeable batteries. Non-rechargeable batteries do not have to be bagged. \n\nWhy is this change happening?\nAfter many years of successfully collecting batteries with our battery bucket program, EHS has determined that it is a fire hazard to continue to collect batteries in this fashion and too labor intensive to sort them. Penn State is required by law to collect and recycle rechargeable batteries. Furthermore, batteries must be collected in individual bags so that their terminals cannot touch, preventing fire hazard. \n\nWhat does this mean for your building occupants?\nDue to the need to adjust to changes in safety standards of battery collection, the mailer program is being launched in buildings on campus that previously had battery buckets. Over the past few months, the Sustainability Institute has worked with facilities coordinators and Green Teams to designate a person within a building or department as the leader of battery collection. You can find the contact list on the sustainability.psu.edu/batteries. Each contact person will be in charge of handing out bags to building occupants with used rechargeable batteries and sending the mailer to EHS when necessary. The mailer program will eliminate the need for battery buckets and non-rechargeable battery collection within individual buildings; there will be Central Battery Collection Stations strategically placed in ten locations on campus. These collection stations will allow members of the campus community to recycle both their rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries. \n\nWhen will this occur?\nThe Collection Bins have already been installed in the ten locations around the University Park campus. Notices of the change were sent to all FCs before the holiday break. We hope that you will forward on the information to your building occupants. All building contact persons will receive an email as well. In the first two weeks of January, news of the change will be posted in campus news and social media outlets and in that same timeframe, the buckets will be collected and mailers delivered to the contacts. \n\nYour role:\nWe hope that your Green Team will partner with you to educate your colleagues about the changes and connect them with our online resources at sustainability.psu.edu/batteries. Below is an\xC2\xA0email template\xC2\xA0that you can customize and use to notify the people of the upcoming changes in your building. Please insert the name of the contact from this list into the template before sending and your name in the signature space. \n\xC2\xA0\nIf you have questions:\nVisit the battery resource page which has information about the difference between non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries, central battery collection station locations, building contacts, and frequently asked questions. \nYou can also email recycling@psu.edu with questions.
